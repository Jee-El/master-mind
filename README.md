# Master Mind

There are two modes to play :

- Single Player :

  You play against the computer, which uses knuth algorithm to make a guess.

- Multiplayer :

  You play against someone else locally, the secret code is hidden so they can't really see the code, unless they memorize which combination of key you presssed, which can be either a bunch of numbers, letters, or words.

In both modes, you can play either as :

- The Code Maker :

  You make the secret code (the hints are given by the computer),

- The Code Breaker :

  You have to figure out the secret code.

## Note

It might not work well if you use replit on mobile due to how the input is taken from the user/player, so trying it on a computer is better. (replit is slow on mobile anyways).
